        This website is an implementation of my craft engine.<br>
        The engine is an experimental project whose reason is to build a system that includes a window-based GUI and a data management infrastructure, providing the following functionality:
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
        <li class="list-item">Open data nodes, such as documents and directories, in windows.</li>
        <li class="list-item">Perform this from desktop icons, icons in windows, navigation items, and via API calls.</li>
        <li class="list-item">Equip windows with an appropriate set of behaviours, such as: open, close, focus, drag, resize, take preset states (fullscreen, full-left, full-right), collapse, and pick by head to move the cursor to the top/left/right/bottom edge of the area to make a window fullscreen/full-left/full-right/collapsed (as in Windows 10).</li>
        <li class="list-item">Provide a taskbar with icons of opened windows.</li>
        <li class="list-item">Collapse/restore/focus a window by clicking on corresponding taskbar icon.</li>
        <li class="list-item">Collapse/restore all windows by clicking on the taskbar.</li>
        <li class="list-item">Provide windows and taskbar icons with controls to perform a set of actions on a window.</li>
        <li class="list-item">Provide navigation through the data tree.</li>
        <li class="list-item">Provide a desktop with icons for quick access to selected data nodes.</li>
        <li class="list-item">Implement a data system that manages data nodes and provides an interface for performing actions on data nodes and the data tree, such as: open, close, create, delete, attach, detach, find, and initialize from an external source.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="paragraph">Another idea was to implement all of this within React ecosystem - just for interest - and to design the system in a form of finite state machine- also just because of interesting challenge.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">
        The application is made with React, written in TypeScript, styled with SCSS, and uses RTK as a state manager. Build via ViteJS.<br>
