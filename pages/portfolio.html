        <h2 class="heading secondary">The hobby project</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            It represents a window-based GUI + filesystem on frontend.<br>
            The site you see is built on this engine.<br>
            <a class="link" href="https://github.com/tony-reason/tonyxx/" target="_blank">Sources on GitHub</a><br>
            The idea is:<br>
            a) implement a windowed user interface on the front-end, and equip it with features similar to Windows 10;<br>
            b) provide the application with a data server equipped with an abstract filesystem, functionality to operate the data tree, and API for the actions on data;<br>
            c) rganize the engine in a form of finite state machine.<br>
            Made it for fun - just was interested in such engineering challenge as "implement Windows on React".<br>
            Ecosystem: React, RTK, TS, SCSS, ViteJS.
