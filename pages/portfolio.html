        <h2 class="heading secondary">The hobby project</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            It is window-based GUI + some filesystem on frontend.<br>
            The site you see is built on this engine.<br>
            Made this for fun - just was interested in such engineering challenge as "implement Windows on React".<br>
            The idea is:<br>
            - to implement on front-end a full-fledged window user interfece, where is possible to do everything like in Windows 10;<br>
            - provide this with a data server equipped with abstract filesystem and interface for operating it;<br>
            - organize this all in a form of finite state machine<br>
            Ecosystem: React, RTK, TS, SCSS, ViteJS.<br>
