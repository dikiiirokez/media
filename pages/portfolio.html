        <h2 class="heading secondary">The hobby project</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            It represents a window-based GUI + filesystem on frontend.<br>
            The site you see is built on this engine.<br>
            <a class="link" href="https://github.com/tony-reason/tonyxx/" target="_blank">Sources on GitHub</a>
            The idea is:<br>
            a) implement a full-fledged windowed user interface on the front end, replicating features as in Windows 10;<br>
            b) provide the system with a data server equipped with an abstract filesystem and an interface for data operations;<br>
            c) organize this in a form of finite state machine.<br>
            Made it for fun - just was interested in such engineering challenge as "implement Windows on React".<br>
            Ecosystem: React, RTK, TS, SCSS, ViteJS.<br>
