        <h2 class="heading secondary">About</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">Fascinated by computing technologies since the beginning of my life.<br>Started with serial development way back in 2006.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Initially programmed in C, C++, and Delphi, creating desktop application software such as physical and mathematical modeling and data visualisation systems for Institute of Physics and Engineering, as well as various computation and data management apps for customers mainly related to engeneering and science.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Into front-end I accidentally got involved in 2011, liked it, and have stayed here ever since.<br>Throughout my career, I've had the chance to work on a wide variety of projects: corporate websites, media portals, learning platforms, service sites, fin-tech solutions, CRMs, e-commerce, blogsâ€¦ and so on.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">In development, I'm inspired by problems that are challenging and require brain power. The most fun for me is working on something innovative, creative, and complex. I like to compose algorithms, design architectures, build data models, process data structures, solve engineering tasks, and write beautiful code. As a front-end dev, I like to create interfaces that humans are happy to use.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Also interested in graphic design, mathematics, physics, and computers.</p>
