        <h2 class="title-secondary">Anatolii Shebeko</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">Fascinated by computing technologies since the first years of life.<br>Started with serial development in the far-off 2006.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Initially programmed in C, C++, Delphi, and created desktop application software such as physical & mathematical modelling and data visualisation systems for Institute of Physics and Engineering, and various computation or data management apps for customers mainly related to engeneering and science.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Into front-end I was involved accidentally in 2011, liked it, and left there up to present time.<br>During my career had a chance to work on rich variety of projects: corporate sites, media portals, learning platforms, service sites, fin-tech, CRMs, e-commerce, blogsâ€¦ etc etc.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">In development, I'm inspired by problems than are challenging and need brain efforts. Most fun for me is to work on something innovative, creative and complex. I like to compose algorythms, think on architectures, build data models, process data structures, solve engineering tasks, and write a good code. As a front-end dev, I like to create interfaces that humans are happy to use.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Also, interested in graphical design, mathematics, physics, and computers.</p>
